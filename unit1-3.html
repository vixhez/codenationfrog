    <div><p>Visual Studio Code, Trello, and GitHub were in general all greatly helpful in terms of productivity and efficiency.<br>
      Trello sometimes felt like a paradox in terms of taking time to write out the tasks needed to be completed instead of saving time and just completing them. However, this was a clear investment in time once completed, and added a real clarity to the project, proving itself to be indispensable.<br>
      There were some minor difficulties with Visual Studio Code, when encountering confusion about whether the visual error of the website was rooted in HTML or CSS. But this issue was evidently down to the separate nature of the codes themselves, instead of Visual Studio Code itself.<br>
      In terms of boosted efficiency, it is possible that working as part of a team could have made the project more efficient, as each team member could be delegated a certain page of area of coding, to speed up and streamline the processes. Even though the website project was of an individual nature, Zoom video calling and Slack were incorporated for advice, screen-sharing and code-sharing. This enabled each team member to boost efficiency on their own individual website.</p>

    <br>
    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit3_2">3.2</a><br><br>Ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3></div>
    <p>As previously mentioned, despite the individual nature of the website projects, Zoom video calling and Slack were utilised for sharing of ideas, screen-sharing and tips. However, this could have potentially been developed further for maximum productivity and efficiency. For example, group discussions on which elements everyone was deciding to incorporate into their own website e.g. a navigation bar, and then working through that particular element as a group. In addition, I believe that drawing out on paper a ‘vision’ of the website or creating a mood board before beginning the design work on CSS could have greatly benefited my sense of creative direction. The latter is of course countered by the time constraints experienced in this project, and if more than 5 days had been available then perhaps these techniques could have been utilised.</p>

    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit3_3">3.3</a><br><br>Solutions to improve productivity using IT in digital projects</h3></div>
    <p>In order to improve productivity in IT projects, many methods can be employed.<br>
      One of these is to have set up a Slack channel dedicated to website coding for all of the team to have access to. This could have contained walk-throughs for certain elements of HTML coding and CSS web design, and increased the productivity of each team member and their individual website through shared brain power. Taking this further and relating to a point made in 3.2, a group discussion could have been had to decide about the elements everyone wanted to incorporate into their website, and allocating a day or time for these elements. During this time, the team would all research the element, and post their findings on the Slack channel. This undoubtedly would have benefited the entire team and their projects, as well as their productivity.<br>
      Additionally, allocating 20 minutes in the morning and after lunch, or a similar arrangement, to update Trello and move the tasks around as necessary could have added to the organisation of the day and created a clear sense of direction within the project, ultimately boosting productivity.

    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit3_4">3.4</a><br><br>Testing digital solutions</h3></div>
    <p>In this project, a large part of testing digital solutions was to explore the website thoroughly, clicking all links and checking the format and layout of content was as intended, as well as the content itself. A ‘fresh pair of eyes’ was also greatly beneficial in working toward efficient and complete testing, and it was indispensable to be able to show the website to instructors and peers in order to enable a more objective testing on different devices.</p>
