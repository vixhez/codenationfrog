    <div class="speedy"><h2>Who I am...</h2></div>
    <div><p>My name is Victoria. I am a biology graduate with a passion for frogs and bourbons. If I’m not writing a short story or studying Spanish, I might be busy at my sewing machine making some clothes. Or, more recently… I might be coding!</p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="speedy"><h2>What I've been up to...</h2></div>
    <div><p>I graduated with a degree in biology from the University of Bristol in 2017, an experience that not only enhanced my critical thinking and appreciation of the natural world, but also my writing and management skills, having been the President of the UOB Poetry & Creative Writing Society. I have since worked on diversifying my skill set. Spending some time at an educational charity, I crafted my fundraising and teaching skills. Later on, I polished my customer service abilities through various means, utilising my emotionally intelligent and patient personality. I also recently embarked on a global trip which enhanced even further my love for Planet Earth. I got involved with all sorts, from cycling 750 miles around Japan to working in a small family-owned carpentry company in Canada!</p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="speedy"><h2>What I love about tech and Code Nation...</h2></div>
    <div><p>It is undeniable that tech is becoming increasingly indispensable in our everyday lives, whether we are actively implementing and using the systems or not. The incredible potential held within coding is so exciting, and I believe great and meaningful feats can be achieved with it.
    <br>
    Currently, I am thriving on Code Nation's Develop 3 week course alongside a wonderful instructor and supportive classmates. I am in the process of getting to grips with Python, HTML and CSS, as well as handy tools such as Trello and Slack. My brain is thoroughly enjoying the satisfying challenges of coding so far, and it is becoming increasingly clear to me that a career in development is a path I really want to pursue.</p></div>
