    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit2_1">2.1</a><br><br>Review of the ongoing use of IT tools</h3></div>
    <div><p>Throughout the construction of my website, I have been very happy with the chosen tools employed. Without these excellent tools, my website would not have been possible in its current form.<br>
      Visual Studio Code’s simple and logical layout has enabled me to build the HTML foundations of my website as well as CSS with relative ease, and the error indications as well as suggested syntax lists have been really helpful.<br>
      Trello has been indispensable in keeping the website project on track, by clearly indicating to me which tasks remain, as well as those in progress and completed. This Kan Ban method is an excellent way to plan a day of work, as well as to self-review progress.<br>
      GitHub’s incredibly useful and easy route to publishing websites has been a key route in seeing my website on the World Wide Web.<br>
      Overall, I believe that the IT tools employed throughout this project have enabled optimum efficiency and outcome.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit2_2">2.2</a><br><br>Appropriateness of the selected IT tools</h3></div>
    <p>All of the IT tools selected in this project – Visual Studio Code, Trello, GitHub – were the objects also of the excellent training received through Code Nation. For this reason, they were not only the most logical, but also the most effective choices for the project. A learning-while-doing approach to the tools enabled an exciting journey of discovery-based learning and also a realistic introduction to the tools themselves, which I feel benefited the start of my coding journey greatly.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit2_3">2.3</a><br><br>Assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the final project</h3></div>
    <p>Overall, I am pleased with my website and believe that I have learned and achieved a lot throughout the process of creating it.<br>
      In terms of strengths, my extensive effort in creating a colourful, engaging website can be seen in the final product, and I have employed a consistent (and bright!) colour scheme throughout it, which I believe looks neat and professional. The theme of frogs also runs throughout the whole website, which aims to engage and entertain users. I am also pleased with the navigation bar and think its transparency is striking.<br> 
      In terms of weaknesses, I believe that the homepage is lacking in content. To combat this, I embedded a previous Code Nation project – the Python Temple game – into the homepage using Trinket. However, I still feel that compared to the other pages, the homepage perhaps feels a little bare. Also, I am aware that my website is perhaps an acquired taste, and wouldn’t be appropriate for certain uses e.g. a public services website. The vibrant design is reflective not only of my personality, but also of my new arrival to coding and subsequent desire to discover different appearance possibilities with CSS, of which there are many.

    <br>
    <br>
    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit2_4">2.4</a><br><br>Potential further improvements to the project</h3></div>
    <p>In terms of further improvements to the website, I believe there are endless possibilities for further technical enhancement. For instance, the addition of music to the website could be a great feature, as well as some kind of animated welcoming page before entering the website. As previously mentioned, conceptualising and adding extra content to the homepage would fill it out a little more.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit2_5">2.5</a><br><br>Review of outcomes and their match to requirements and purpose</h3></div>
    <p>I believe that my website match requirements satisfactorily, as it covers information about myself, as well as a demonstration of my interest in technology and acts as a portfolio of my website-building skills.<br>
      Trello has been an essential tool in reminding me which elements need to be implemented to bring me closer to the goals and purposes of the project.<br>
      In terms of ensuring the project outcome is fit for purpose, I ensured this was the case by checking the website and clicking through different combinations of links, as well as proof-reading content, to ensure an appropriate and valid manifestation of requirements. Receiving assistance from others in doing this also benefited me greatly as it provided a ‘fresh pair of eyes’.</p>
