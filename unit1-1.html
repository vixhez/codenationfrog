<div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit1_1">1.1</a><br><br>The purpose of IT in modern business</h3></div>
<div><p>In the developed world, it would be rare to come across a business that hadn’t utilised information technology to boost its operations in some capacity.
<br>
Information technology has allowed businesses to sharpen their focus, utilising the powerful loyalty of technology. Cumbersome filing cabinets full of endless physical documents have become files stored neatly in a server. Not only is this less frustrating, it also means that the hours previously spent on administration can now be rechannelled into other areas of the business, thus streamlining overall efficiency.
<br>
Customer relationship management systems have revolutionised the calibre of customer service in businesses that are introducing information technology into this area of their organisation. The ability to immediately gain context on the customer getting in touch enables a closer and more informed rapport between customer and business. Whether it be to enquire about a delayed delivery or a problem logging into an online account, a customer relationship management system is an excellent tool to smooth out queries and problems.
<br>
The accessibility within businesses that is granted by implementing information technology has potentially never been more relevant than right now in the Covid-19 pandemic. The work of entire departments has been able to continue through the use of video calling, music lessons have moved online and internet shopping has provided a salvation for those in need of supplies but unable to leave the house.
<br>
Overall, information technology has a wealth of uses within businesses, and as it continues to evolve, these uses are likely to diversify further.

<div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit1_2">1.2</a><br><br>The ingredients needed for a successful digital project</h3></div>
<p>Digital projects can take on a huge variety of forms, and therefore the methods, skills and resources needed to complete them are also highly diverse. Skills and experience arguably build the foundations of a quality project, as well as clear communication with the client to conceptualise a watertight brief. The resources are equally important; enabling the project to become a reality.
<br>
The core equipment needed for a project would be material to encode, relevant software to be able to process the material, and a computer system upon which the software would run.
<br>
For example, in the case of generating a website, Visual Studio Code would be an ideal choice of software to run on a computer since it is able to work with HTML and CSS, building an engaging website. Content of the website would be provided by the client and would be implemented into the relevant sections of code.

<div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit1_3">1.3</a><br><br>Planning and carrying out tasks using IT</h3></div>
<p>Implementing IT as part of the planning and executing processes for tasks, namely the website project, has proved an indispensable tool. The organised nature of tech, as opposed to being surrounded by dog-eared post-it notes, has clear benefits for clarity of goals as well as motivation.
<br>
Trello is an excellent example of a programme that enables the planning of tasks to be succinct and effective. Utilising the Kan Ban method, a clear separation of ‘To Do, Doing and Done’ enables the user to gauge their progress within the project. The visual element of Trello works especially well for those who have dominant visual methods of learning and interpreting, and provides a ‘clean’ interface, splitting a project into manageable sections and giving an overall sense of organisation. The Trello board for this particular website can be found <a href="https://trello.com/b/0k9F01MR" target="_blank">here</a>.

<div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit1_4">1.4</a><br><br>The risks and failures associated with digital projects</h3></div>
<p>Many risks impact digital projects, and it is important to be aware of and remain flexible to these. Room for risks should be created within the planning process.
<br>
The fast-moving nature of technology is both a blessing and a curse, and can be the latter in the case of risks. For example, a project in development may suddenly not work as expected due to an update of the operating system.
<br>
Unexpected errors in equipment can also cause problems within digital projects, and loss of data is often one of these. This potential situation creates the need to routinely back up work to a server to avoid precious work being lost.
<br>
Security breaches are also a risk within digital projects, and in an increasingly consent-driven world, could cause serious negative consequences for not only the rapport with the client but for the overall project. It is essential to ensure equipment used as part of the digital project is free of spyware and also that any physical data associated with the project is kept safe and locked away.
<br>
As with any collaborative project, a lack of teamwork and communication can also cause core problems that in turn affect all other elements of the project and lead to an unsatisfied client and a project not fulfilled to its true potential.

<br>
<br>
<div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit1_5">1.5</a><br><br>Selection and usage of IT systems and software</h3></div>
<p>The preferred IT systems and software for the project is entirely dependent on the context. For instance, the operating system and software that those involved in the project have the most experience with would likely be advisable, provided it is a viable option. Consideration of the client’s preferences should of course also come into account. In terms of system choice, practical arrangements should be considered. For example, those that travel as they work or enjoy working in cafes would likely prefer a laptop or other portable device to complete the digital project on.</p>
<br>
<br>
<div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit1_6">1.6</a><br><br>Analysis of chosen technologies in achieving outcomes</h3></div>
<p>The range of technologies implemented in this project have been incredibly important in facilitating its efficiency and clarity.<br>
  Visual Studio Code has been incredible in terms of building the base HTML code to act as a foundation to everything else, as well as the important customisations made possible through CSS. The user-friendly interface of VS Code, as well as its pop-up menus when typing in syntax, have been very useful in creating different types of code.<br>
  Where organisation is concerned, Trello has been a wonderful tool in making tasks into visual, manageable chunks. The Kan Ban method employed in Trello has been particularly effective, giving a sense of progress, as well as a reminder of the remaining parts of the project to be completed.
  GitHub is the domain of choice to host the website, which is completed through an online profile. This brilliant tool enables me to see the website in real time and out there for the world to see, and provides a highly accessible route for people who want their websites to gain some recognition.</p>
<br>
<br>
<div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit1_7">1.7</a><br><br>Legal guidelines and constraints impacting digital projects</h3></div>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an essential consideration when embarking on a digital project, and its rules apply to organisations that collect data related to people in the EU, regardless of where they are based. It came into effect for all organisations on the 25th of May 2018.
<br>
A large part of GDPR is the need to receive informed and specific consent from a data subject in order to process their data. Relating to data security, GDPR expects organisations to protect people’s data with appropriate technical and organisation measures. GDPR requires accountability from organisations in complying with the regulations, whether this be through staff training or having data processing contracts in place with other organisations that process data for that organisation, most likely both.
<br>
GDPR is a non-negotiable element of digital projects, for both moral reasons and the fact that fines for violations are extremely high. The existence of this set of regulations deems it essential to make extra considerations during digital projects. For example, a dedicated page on a website to explain the use of cookies, and instructions for how to opt-out of certain types of cookie. Training in data protection may also be recommendable for those involved in a digital project.
