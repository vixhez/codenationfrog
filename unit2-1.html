    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit_1_1">1.1</a><br><br>Description of the content and layout of each page</h3></div>
    <div><p>The entire website adopts a consistent format and a frog theme, with a different high resolution picture of a frog as the fixed background on each page, as well as a teal, lime green, and hot pink colour theme with paragraphs in a dark grey and links in the previously mentioned hot pink. Titles under 'h1' and 'h2' classifications are in lime green. I used two fonts throughout the website, Faster One and Stylish, both obtained from Google Fonts. My backup font is Trebuchet MS. The navigation bar and main content box both have a slightly transparent teal background, designed not only for style but also to ensure the frog background pictures can be seen well. Initially, there were some issues with the fixed frog picture backgrounds, as the picture seemed to only extend as far down the page as the content did, which was a problem on the contact page in particular, as it has less content. However, after liaising with an instructor, I was able to work through this issue with a great result.<br>
      The homepage contains the previously developed ‘Python Temple’, the text-based adventure game created with my Code Nation team mates. I utilised Trinket to embed this.
      The About Me page features my background, skills, and interest in tech, as well as a photo of myself to add life and personality.<br>
      My unit pages containing the course work are hidden in a drop down menu and appear when hovering over the ‘Units’ element of the menu. Each of these pages employ a series of in-page hyperlinks, which enables the user to jump to which section of text they would like to read. References used appear under the corresponding paragraph, with a new tab link to the original source.<br>
      My Contact page contains both a mailto: link and a link that opens in a new tab to my LinkedIn profile. I removed my email address from the mailto: section of code when publishing on GitHub, however, in the interests of privacy.</p>

    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit_1_5">1.5</a><br><br>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3></div>
    <p>In an increasingly connected and informed world, copyright is an element of website design and ownership not to be taken lightly. The Copyright Designs and Patents Act of 1988 is one of the main legal rights created during the set up of a new website. It provides automatic copyright protection to any musical, dramatic, artistic, film, literary or broadcast work that matches the Act’s definition of originality upon creation.<br>
      Different elements of a website will often belong to different people, deeming it necessary to assign copyrights where they are due and understanding what can be done with different elements of the website.
      One major constraint of website ownership is the non-negotiable effort required to avoid accidentally ending up accused of copyright infringement. Text, images and domain names can all be easily accessed, but could just as easily belong to someone else. Therefore, extra measures such as checking domains and content with Nominet and the Intellectual Property Office should be taken to ensure no negative repercussions.<br>
      Consumer law is another consideration that must be taken by website owners and operators. These include laws on issues such as accessibility requirements, data protection (as covered in Unit 1 - 1.7) and cookies. Overall, it is imperative to have an awareness of copyright and other constraints before taking on the responsibility of setting up a website.

    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit_1_6">1.6</a><br><br>Accessibility issues to be taken into account</h3></div>
    <p>The World Wide Web is an incredible tool, and has the potential to benefit all that are able to use it. Therefore, it is essential that people with disabilities are able to access it. In order to avoid excluding people, it is important for organisations and developers to have a sufficient understanding of accessibility and its importance. Accessibility benefits people with lifelong disabilities as well as those experiencing ‘situational limitations’, such as a broken arm, or changing abilities as a result of ageing.<br>
      There are countless examples of how a website can be made more accessible. For instance, including alternative text for images means people using screen readers can interpret a description of an image, enabling a richer user experience. Another example would be the implementation of transcripts for audio files on websites, enabling people that are deaf to access an equal amount of content as others.

    <div><h3 class="speedy"><a id="unit_1_7">1.7</a><br><br>Appropriate file types for websites</h3></div>
    <p>A wide range of file types can be found across websites. HTML (HyperText Markup Language file) and CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) are commonly used, as well as plug-ins such as Adobe Flash Player, which enable a richer user experience through features such as animations and embedded content. Pictures in JPG/JPEG (Joint Photographic [Experts] Group file) format can be seen far and wide, as can the series of pictures on loop that is the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format). MP3 (MPEG Layer 3 sound file) and MPG/MPEG (Motion Picture [Experts] Group file) are appropriate file types for pictures and videos respectively. PDF (Portable Document Format) files are useful for ensuring documents can be transferred between computers and still look identical.
